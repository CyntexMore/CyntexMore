# Welcome to my profile!

I'm not working on anything serious. I'm just coding for fun.

I'm learning __Python__.

I only know __Python__ on a mehh.. level, I don't really know other languages, maybe how to write out Hello World in __C++__, __C#__ but I can't do serious things in those other languages, to be honest not even in __Pyton__.
